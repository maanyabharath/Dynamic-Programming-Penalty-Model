# Sequence Alignment Using Dynamic Programming

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of sequence alignment using dynamic programming (DP). The algorithm calculates the alignment score between two DNA sequences (`s1` and `s2`) based on match and mismatch scoring criteria. The DP approach is implemented using recursion with memoization.

## Features
1. **Random DNA Sequence Generation**:
   - Two DNA sequences (`s1` and `s2`) are generated by shuffling the string "aaaaccccggggtttt".

2. **Dynamic Programming Alignment**:
   - A scoring matrix (`model`) is used to store intermediate results.
   - Match score: **+5**
   - Mismatch score: **-4**

3. **Recursive Function with Memoization**:
   - Avoids redundant computations by storing intermediate results in the DP table (`model`).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: `random`

## How It Works
1. **Input**:
   - Two DNA sequences (`s1` and `s2`) of length 16 are randomly generated from the string "aaaaccccggggtttt".

2. **Algorithm**:
   - A recursive DP function (`dp`) computes the alignment score for the two sequences:
     - Base case: If either sequence is empty, the score is 0.
     - Match: Adds **+5** to the score if characters match.
     - Mismatch: Adds **-4** to the score for mismatched characters.
   - Intermediate results are stored in a 2D array (`model`) to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Output**:
   - The final alignment score between `s1` and `s2`.
